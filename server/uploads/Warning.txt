**THIS FILE OF EXTREME IMPORTANCE**
# DO NOT DELETE THIS FILE...

THIS FILE IS KEEPS THE UPLOAD DIRECTOR PRESENT. THE UPLOAD DIRECTORY
IS TIED STRICTLY WITH THE IMAGE UPLOAD PROCESS...

FULL EXPLANATION --> IN THE POST HANDLER, WE HAVE THE "UPLOAD" DIRECTORY MUST EXIST
                     BECAUSE WE SEND THE FILES WE UPLOAD STRAIGHT INTO THE UPLOAD
                     DIRECTORY. THE UPLOAD DIRECTORY WILL REMAIN EMPTY REGARDLESS
                     OF HOW MANY TIMES YOU TRY TO ADD AN IMAGE... WHY? I DON'T KNOW
                     WHAT I DO KNOW IS THAT IT STORES THE IMAGES IN THERE ON APPLICATION
                     RUNTIME AND THE DATABASE STORES A REFERENCE TO WITHIN THE IMAGE OBJECT,
                     SPECIFICALLY THE "DATA" ATTRIBUTE, WHICH HOUSES THE FULL PATH TO THE
                     UPLOAD DIRECTORY + THE IMAGE (IN NUMBER FORM). WHEN EXTRACTING THE IMAGE
                     FROM THE DATABASE, IT OPENS THE IMAGE OBJECT AFTER EACH ITERATION, AND USES
                     THE FULL PATH TO OPEN THE IMAGE ON THE FRONT-END FROM THE UPLOADS FOLDER...

TLDR --> DO NOT REMOVE THIS TXT FILE, AND THE DO NOT REMOVE THE UPLOAD DIRECTORY
         EVEN THOUGH IT MAY APPEAR EMPTY. THIS HOUSES INFORMATION "INVISIBLY."
